1. App.js

Purpose: The main entry point of the application that manages the overall state and handles file selection and XML parsing.

Key Functions and Code Blocks:

    handleFilePick:

        Purpose: To allow users to pick an XML file from their device.

        Explanation: This function uses react-native-document-picker to open a file picker. Once a file is selected, it fetches the file data and converts it to text format, which is then passed to the parseXML function.

    parseXML:

        Purpose: To parse the XML string into a JavaScript object.

        Explanation: This function utilizes xml2js to convert the XML string into a JavaScript object. If the parsing fails, it alerts the user about the invalid format; otherwise, it updates the state with the parsed data.

2. FormRenderer.js
Purpose: To render the form based on the parsed XML data.

Key Functions and Code Blocks:

    FormRenderer Component:

        Purpose: To dynamically create form fields based on the XML structure.

        Explanation: This component iterates over the fields defined in the parsed XML data. It calls the renderField function for each field to generate the appropriate input component.

    renderField Function:

        Purpose: To determine the type of input field to render based on the field type in the XML.

        Explanation: This function checks the type of each field and returns the corresponding React Native component (e.g., TextInput, DatePicker, etc.). For radio buttons, it calls another function renderRadioButtons.

3. XMLInput.js

Purpose: To provide a text input area for users to enter XML directly.

Key Functions and Code Blocks:

    XMLInput Component:
    
        Purpose: To accept XML input from users and parse it.

        Explanation: This component consists of a TextInput for XML input and a button to submit the XML. When submitted, it calls the parseXML function to process the input.
